terminal (Mac OSX). Execute the script by entering the directory in which
you downloaded the files, and typing the following:

python genometranscription.py filename

where "filename" references a text file in ATCG format with no spaces.


An example file has been attached, and can be referenced by:

python genometranscription.py testsequence.txt
